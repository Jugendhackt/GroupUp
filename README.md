Hello and welcome to
# GroupUp

### Okay... and what is this?
GroupUp is an online platform on which you can create project **ideas** (Not any Projects which get worked on already!!! It's just to find a group!)


### W-why would you need something like that?
We tried to find a project which was good for us... but instead we just found a overfilled hall with tons of posters hanging on the walls where you couldn't even see a single bit because so many people wanted to look at them.
We try to fight this problem with GroupUp.

Since it's digital (and everyone got these days a smartphone) you can just hide in a corner and look at all the project ideas without trying to get somehow on front to it to read anything!

### Does that mean I need to create an account now to share my idea on a local event?
Haha of course not!
You just enter your name (or username depends on what you like more) to avoid conflicts with people who got the same name you can first check if the name is already getting used! If so you should try to take another name.

### So does it just make the group finding digital? What about more features?
We got some sweet features you wouldn't be able to use in real life!
We got a search and tags. So you can search for specific languages you're interessted in or for topics you like!
We also got comments! So you can suggest your ideas and contribute without even joining the group!
Did We mention that you can also see who joined the group and join YOURSELF? It's very good if you try to meet up somewhere and so you know already what the other peeps are called!

### Can I also delete project ideas?

You can. But why try to delete an idea if you can edit it or comment on it or even JOIN IT?

### Sounds Nice. Can I help ya?

Of course you can! We're on Github! Just fork this repository and make changes to it! Just make sure to hold on to the MIT License! (The LICENSE File)
